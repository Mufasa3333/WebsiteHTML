    <h1>   Dinosaurs are dangerous woohooo!</h1>

    <h2> What are dinosaurs?</h2>

    <p> Dinosaurs apeard in many many many years ago, the scientest calculated it and its about 167 million years ago! Thats a huge number for sure! But wait? How did people discovered the dinasours? Human maximum apeared before like one million years ago? And then how? </p>

    <p> Well, Dinosaurs were discovered by British scientists The whole world was home to these extinct reptiles, but it was British palaeontologists who found the fossils and figured out what they were!  </p>

    <h3> PT.2 (Fossils)</h3>

    <p> As you saw in the picture the fossils look insane! These things you saw are <b>bones</b>, sometimes some of the other bones get disappeared by the time.</p>

    <p> Let's have a closer look what is the shape of Dinosaurs, for a short answer, they  fall into one of two major groups that have traditionally been defined by <i>hip shape</i>. Now, The dinosaur hip is primarily divided into <b>three parts</b>. There is the ilium (the large, upper flange of the hips), the ischium (a smaller spine that runs below and behind) and the pubis (another slender extension of the lower hip that can be found in various orientations from front to back).</p>

    <h3> PT.3 (Extinction of Dinosaurs) </h3>
    <p> Now Dinosaurs doesn't exist anymore and all of it know it. But how? Like in our childhood we saw how it does but let's have a deep look how it <strong>actually</strong> done</p>


    <p>
        For 165 million years, dinosaurs dominated land, sea, and sky. Long-necked Brachiosauruses lumbered along like mobile four-story buildings. Tyrannosaurus rex chased down prey with 50 to 60 teeth as big as bananas. Mosasaurs stretching 55 feet from snout to tail terrorized the seas, consuming everything they could catch.

        But 66 million years ago, the world's climate drastically changed. Dinosaurs had thrived in the warm temperatures and mild weather of the Mesozoic era. All of a sudden, the Earth became much colder and darker. Plants died and food became scarce. All the dinosaurs—except for the ancestors of modern birds—and three quarters of the creatures living on Earth went extinct.

        To this day, scientists debate what caused this sudden change. The leading theories involve an asteroid strike and a giant volcano.

    <h3> PT.4 (Facts)</h3>

    <p> So, after we knew a little bit of Dinasours, let's see what is the facts and intersting things about Dinasaurs:</p>

    <p> ⚫ The first dinosaurs evolved during the middle to late Triassic period—about 230 million years ago—in the part of the supercontinent of Pangea that now corresponds with South America. Before then, the dominant land reptiles were archosaurs (ruling lizards), therapsids (mammal-like reptiles), and pelycosaurs (typified by Dimetrodon). For 20 million or so years after dinosaurs evolved, the most fearsome reptiles on Earth were prehistoric crocodiles. It was only at the beginning of the Jurassic period, 200 million years ago, that dinosaurs truly began their rise to dominance. </p>
    <p> ⚫ With our 100-year-max life spans, humans aren't well adapted to understanding "deep time," as geologists call it. To put things in perspective: Modern humans have only existed for a few hundred thousand years, and human civilization only got started about 10,000 years ago, mere blinks of the eye by Jurassic time scales. Everyone talks about how dramatically (and irrevocably) the dinosaurs went extinct, but judging by the whopping 165 million years they managed to survive, they may have been the most successful vertebrate animals ever to colonize Earth.</p>
    <p> ⚫ You'd think it would be most logical to divide dinosaurs into herbivores (plant-eaters) and carnivores (meat-eaters), but paleontologists see things differently, distinguishing between saurischian ("lizard-hipped") and ornithischian ("bird-hipped") dinosaurs. Saurischian dinosaurs include both carnivorous theropods and herbivorous sauropods and prosauropods, while ornithischians account for the remainder of plant-eating dinosaurs, including hadrosaurs, ornithopods, and ceratopsians, among other dinosaur types. Oddly enough, birds evolved from "lizard-hipped," rather than "bird-hipped," dinosaurs.</p>
    <p> ⚫ Not every paleontologist is convinced—and there are some alternate (albeit not widely accepted) theories—but the bulk of the evidence points to modern birds having evolved from small, feathered, theropod dinosaurs during the Late Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. Bear in mind, though, that this evolutionary process may have happened more than once and that there were definitely some "dead ends" along the way (witness the tiny, feathered, four-winged Microraptor, which has left no living descendants). In fact, if you look at the tree of life cladistically—that is, according to shared characteristics and evolutionary relationships—it's completely appropriate to refer to modern birds as dinosaurs.</p>
    <p> ⚫ Modern reptiles like turtles and crocodiles are cold-blooded, or "ectothermic," meaning they need to rely on the external environment to maintain their internal body temperatures. Modern mammals and birds are warm-blooded, or "endothermic," possessing active, heat-producing metabolisms that maintain constant internal body temperature, no matter the external conditions. There's a solid case to be made that at least some meat-eating dinosaurs—and even a few ornithopods—must have been endothermic since it's hard to imagine such an active lifestyle being fueled by a cold-blooded metabolism. On the other hand, it's unlikely that giant dinosaurs like Argentinosaurus were warm-blooded since they would have cooked themselves from the inside out in a matter of hours.</p>
    <p> ⚫ Fierce carnivores like Tyrannosaurus rex and Giganotosaurus get all the press, but it's a fact of nature that the meat-eating "apex predators" of any given ecosystem are tiny in number compared to the plant-eating animals on which they feed (and which themselves subsist on the vast amounts of vegetation needed to sustain such large populations). By analogy with modern ecosystems in Africa and Asia, herbivorous hadrosaurs, ornithopods, and to a lesser extent sauropods, probably roamed the world's continents in vast herds, hunted by sparser packs of large-, small-, and medium-sized theropods.</p>
    <p> ⚫ Many people mistakenly believe that mammals "succeeded" the dinosaurs 65 million years ago, appearing everywhere, all at once, to occupy the ecological niches rendered vacant by the K-T extinction event. The fact is, though, that early mammals lived alongside sauropods, hadrosaurs, and tyrannosaurs (usually high up in trees, away from the heavy foot traffic) for most of the Mesozoic Era. In fact, they evolved at around the same time—during the late Triassic period—from a population of therapsid reptiles. Most of these early furballs were about the size of mice and shrews, but a few (like the dinosaur-eating Repenomamus) grew to respectable sizes of 50 pounds or so.</p>

    <p> So, we got a really good background of what is Dinosaurs, of course you can seach for more information if you are interested it, and I actually highly reccomend you to do that. There are tons of websites you can read, we will give you our top 5 websites you can take it as a references. Good luck and wish you a nice day!</p>
